      "Power NBA Analytics is a startup project aimed at helping aspiring sports commentators improve their content through data visualizations. The app offers features such as team win rates comparison, team vs NBA statistics, player performance rankings, and salary vs performance analysis. It uses advanced data analytics to provide customizable, low-cost visualizations tailored to basketball teams and individual players' statistics, designed for commentators and sports analysts.\n\nThe project was created by a group of students from the DBA3702 (Descriptive Analytics with R) module at the National University of Singapore. The project uses data visualizations and cleaning techniques primarily with R, while data scraping is done with Python using BeautifulSoup. It utilizes libraries like Shiny, ggplot2, and plotly for visualizations and data manipulation, and BeautifulSoup for scraping data from websites to gather salary information for the 2020-2021 season.",
